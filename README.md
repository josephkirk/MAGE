# MAGE Framework
## Modular Actor Gameplay Extension System

MAGE is a high-performance, modular gameplay framework for Unreal Engine that bridges ECS principles with Unreal's actor-component model. It provides a structured approach to building scalable game systems while maintaining compatibility with Unreal Engine's ecosystem.

## Overview

MAGE combines the best aspects of Entity Component System (ECS) architecture with Unreal Engine's native patterns:

- **Data-Oriented Design**: Clear separation between data (components) and logic (systems)
- **Modular Architecture**: Systems are isolated, maintainable, and easily toggled
- **Performance Focused**: Optimized component updates without per-frame ticking
- **Unreal Integration**: Seamless integration with Unreal Engine's features
- **Game Feature Plugins**: Built on UE's modular gameplay feature system
- **Event-Driven**: Rich event system for component communication

## Key Features

- üèóÔ∏è **Modular Systems**: Self-contained gameplay systems that can be enabled/disabled at runtime
- üéÆ **Game Feature Integration**: Built on UE's game feature plugin system
- üîå **Component Framework**: Lightweight, data-focused components
- ‚ö° **Event System**: Robust event handling between components and systems
- üéØ **Tag-based Queries**: Efficient component queries using gameplay tags
- üõ†Ô∏è **Development Tools**: Debug visualization and system monitoring
- üìä **Performance Tools**: Built-in profiling and optimization utilities

## Getting Started

1. **Installation**
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/mage-framework.git

# Add to your project's plugins directory
cp -r mage-framework/MAGE [YourProject]/Plugins/
```

2. **Basic Setup**
```cpp
// Enable the plugin in your project
// Edit [YourProject].uproject:
{
    "Plugins": [
        {
            "Name": "MAGE",
            "Enabled": true
        }
    ]
}
```

3. **Create Your First System**
```cpp
UCLASS()
class UHealthSystem : public UMAGESystem
{
    GENERATED_BODY()
public:
    virtual void Initialize() override;
    virtual void Update(float DeltaTime) override;
};
```

## Example Usage

```cpp
// Create a component
UCLASS()
class UHealthComponent : public UMAGEComponent
{
    GENERATED_BODY()
    
public:
    UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere)
    float MaxHealth = 100.0f;
    
    UPROPERTY(Replicated)
    float CurrentHealth = 100.0f;
};

// Create a game feature
UCLASS()
class UHealthFeature : public UMAGEFeatureData
{
    GENERATED_BODY()
    
public:
    UHealthFeature()
    {
        SystemClasses.Add(UHealthSystem::StaticClass());
    }
};
```
